# RUST AI

## Simple Project
I was mainly just messing around a little AI was used in places, so this is the disclaimer, but 
really im just experimenting around trying to better my skills with C# and python.

# Structure

## Python Structure
The Python script hosts an Express Server and runs the backend Reinforcement learning Tensorflow ML Bot 
The C# plugin calls HTTP requests to the Express Server and the server calls some stuff with the AI and the
Rust plugins converts the inputs into the NPC.

## C# Plugin Structure
The plugin interprets and displays the information the AI has done, the plugin as well gives the AI the enviroment information.

# Overall
This will indeed be very messy, and I'm not doing this to be clean and readable. I'm putting this up if you want to take a look for compile it / run it yourself you can.
I'm not garenteeing continued updates / support, and there is a large possibility I will abondon the project before its fully completed. Again I'm just a young teen trying
to experienment with Rust and the Carbon Framework.
Thanks!
